# Next.js 15 Strict Mode Bug: Unexpected behavior with simple div return

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Next.js 15's strict mode related to how components handle simple div returns without additional JSX expressions.  When a component returns only a `<div>`, it may not implicitly return null or undefined as expected under strict mode, causing unexpected errors.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the Next.js development server.
4. Navigate to `/about`. You will observe an error in your browser console.

## Solution

The solution is to always ensure that components explicitly return a valid JSX element, even if it's just a simple div.  Adding a simple JSX expression inside the div, like a space `&nbsp;`, resolves the issue.

## Additional notes

This issue highlights the increased rigor of strict mode in Next.js 15.  It's crucial to carefully review the return values of all components to prevent this type of error.
